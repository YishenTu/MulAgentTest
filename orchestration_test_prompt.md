# Multi-Agent Orchestration Test Prompt

Please implement the 4 tasks defined in `parallel_tasks.md` using parallel sub-agents. You should:

1. Act as an orchestrator and spawn 4 separate agents to work on each task simultaneously
2. Each agent should work independently on their assigned task
3. Monitor the progress of all agents
4. Report back when all tasks are completed

Please coordinate the agents efficiently and provide a summary when all tasks are done.
